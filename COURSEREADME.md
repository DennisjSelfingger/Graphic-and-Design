'''QUESTION'''

How do I approach designing software?
'''ANSWER'''

Working on this project has significantly enhanced my software design skills, particularly in understanding and applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like inheritance 
and encapsulation within C++. The hands-on experience with OpenGL deepened my grasp of handling colors and textures in a 3D environment, providing a practical application of theoretical 
concepts. Following a structured design process, I first outlined the requirements and then incrementally developed the functionalities, ensuring each component interacted seamlessly 
through well-defined interfaces. This approach not only streamlined the development but also made debugging more manageable. These strategies will be invaluable in future projects, where 
the principles of OOP and structured design can be applied to create more robust and scalable software solutions.

'''QUESTION'''

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

'''ANSWER'''

In developing programs, my approach emphasizes a clear understanding of foundational concepts before diving deep into complex functionalities. While working on the 3D scene project, I didn't 
introduce new strategies but instead refined existing knowledge and skills, drawing heavily on prior assignments. This project reinforced the iterative nature of software developmentâ€”constantly 
cycling through coding, testing, and debugging. Each iteration helped me to understand and fine-tune the interactions of various components such as texture handling, camera controls, and shader 
management.

Throughout the project milestones, my development approach evolved to become more proactive about debugging and understanding every line of code. Instead of waiting for errors to pile up, 
I tackled issues as they arose, which significantly streamlined the development process. This method not only minimized potential disruptions but also deepened my understanding of each part
of the program, ensuring that I was not just writing code, but also learning from it. This iterative refinement has solidified my skills in C++ and OpenGL and prepared me to tackle future projects
with a stronger foundation and a more strategic approach.
